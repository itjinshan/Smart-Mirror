SJSU CMPE/SE Senior Project 195 ---- Smart Mirror

## Project Abstract

Many individuals participate in the same morning ritual: wake up, get ready for
work/school and check the news. A 2014 NBC survey found that adult women spend 6.4
hours/week and adult men spend 4.5 hours/week to spend time and care for their appearance.
Another survey in 2017 by Tech Times found that 46% admitted to checking their smartphones
in the morning before getting out of bed.

Nowadays, almost everyone owns a smartphone and use them heavily every day getting
real-time information. Many people find themselves feeling anxious when their smartphones
aren’t around and can drastically decrease their efficiency on performing other tasks having to
free up their hands to use their smartphones. Most smartphones won’t allow the user to check
their appearance with their camera while using certain apps or voice activation and some people
can’t spend time in front of a mirror getting ready while using their phone at the same time. This
inefficient multitasking slows people down which defeats the purpose of smart technology.

This project allows people to multitask as they take care of their appearance while also
staying up to date on current events, news headlines, weather, etc. The voice activated mirror
provides a hands free experience by displaying what the user asks for, allowing the user to get
ready in front of the mirror. Thus, this product saves time and increases productivity to care for
one’s appearance while staying up to date with the latest events.

### Project Management

#### Story-Board Rules

Story-Board link: https://github.com/itjinshan/Smart-Mirror/projects/1

```
#To Do
The 'To Do' list is populated with issues (aka stories) that are not yet assigned to any developer.
Those stories are generally created by the Team Lead. If need be, developer can create stories but need to inform Team Lead.
Developers can assign stories to themselves and start working on them on a local branch.

#In Progress
When a story gets (self-)assigned, drag and drop the story into 'In Progress'

#Needs Review
As soon as the developer has code ready, a remote branch and a corresponding pull request can be created.
The newly created pull request is automatically added to the 'Needs Review' column.
Please make sure to follow naming convention when creating new pull request.
A new developer must be assigned to the pull request to review the code changes.

For the reviewer:
Please check the logic of the code, and make sure it follows good style.
Test the code changes by running the code locally.
If updates are needed, write a review and wait for author to make changes.
When satisfied, merge code into dev-branch.

#Done
The code is now merged into the dev-branch.
Finished stories will be accumulated in the 'Done' column. They will be periodically archived by the Team Lead.
Issue should still be 'In Progress' and can also be archived.
```

#### Pull Request Rules

```
When raising a pull request,
- please use following naming convention: "SJSU-1234, Created new Feature" (same naming as issue)
- add project "Smart-Mirror-Story Board"
- please create a comment, describing the changes you made
- please make sure to tag the minimum amount of required reviewers.
- please inform the reviewers that you tagged them
```

#### Naming Rules

```
Branches:
Use same naming convention as the corresponding issue, f.e. "SJSU-1097"

For Development Issues, start with SJSU-1000 and on;
For Program Bug Patch Issues, start with SJSU-5000 and on;
For Project Setup (None Code) Issues, start with SJSU-0000 and on;

Pull Requests/Commit:
Use issue/story number + short description of work, f.e. "SJSU-1097, Updated Login screen"
```
